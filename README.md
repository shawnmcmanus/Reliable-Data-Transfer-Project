# Reliable-Data-Transfer-Project
This is a project from my Networking class that tested reliable data transfer over an unreliable path. The rdt_layer.py file requires code that I created while the rest of the files were provided for the assignment.


You can test different text in the rdt_main.py file and toggle on/off the different "unreliable" features (packet loss, corrupted packets, timeouts, etc.).
